# RPCA_actional_recognition
In human action recognition, visual feature descriptors are of vital importance. We propose a novel thought of getting the low-rank features and sparse features from the video. This ideal is based on the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), and obtained through sparse component and low-rank on the raw image pixels of each video. Then we use the two-stream architecture for our robust PCA segmentation descriptors with fine-tuning.
